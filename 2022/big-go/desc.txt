Title:  Big Code Bases And Go

Abstract:
Big code bases have traditionally been monolithic applications full of spaghetti code.
Now we have micro services everywhere and they usually lead to spaghetti architecture.
The middle ground seems to be nice but hard to navigate.

We start with a little introduction to Go and its feature to structure code bases.
Next we see how dependencies between parts of the code base can be documented with a small open source tool.
Finally we explore how big code bases can be analysed and understood.
